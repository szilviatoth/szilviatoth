### Hi there, I'm Szilvia 👋

**szilviatoth/szilviatoth** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
Fresh and crunhy out of a coding bootcamp. 
I'm really into the way front-end and back-end development work together. It's interesting to see how user interfaces link up with server-side tech. 
Right now, I'm putting this into practice by building a bucket list planner, which is helping me get the hang of how both sides work together.
